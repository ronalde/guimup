    GUIMUP
    version 0.3.2

    for MPD 0.16.0 and above.
    ______________________________________________________________________

    GUIMUP is a client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD) written in c++ and
    Gtkmm. The program can be used with most Linux desktops (KDE, GNOME, XFCE)
    and is covered by the General Public License (see LICENSE below).

    The clean interface makes controlling MPD's many features easy and intuitive.
    The focus is on mouse handling: playlist management is done entirely by
    drag-&-drop; playback functions are directly accessible from the system tray.
    Guimup turns MPD into a perfect desktop music player.

    integrated with Gnome in any way.

    USING GUIMUP

    If MPD is configured correctly it's all click, drag and drop really.

    ****** CHECK OUT THE TIPS IN THE SETTINGS WINDOW ('ABOUT' TAB) ******

    EXTERNAL FILES

    Audio files that are not in the MPD database can be dropped on the
    playlist. Alternatively the 'send to' or 'open with' command in your file
    manager can be used.

    But this will only work if the connection with mpd is established through
    a so called socket. In MPD's configuration file the bind_to_address must
    point to "~/.mpd/socket" (replace ~ with the full path to your 'home' dir).
    In Guimup's login profile (in the settings window) 'Host' must be set
    exactly the same.
