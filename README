    GUIMUP is a client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD) written in GTKMM and
    C++. The program can be used with most Linux desktops (GNOME, XFCE, KDE)
    and is covered by the General Public License (see LICENSE below).

    The clean interface makes controlling MPD's many features easy and intuitive.
    The focus is on mouse handling: playlist management is done entirely by
    drag-&-drop; playback functions are directly accessible from the system tray.
    Guimup turns MPD into a perfect desktop music player.
