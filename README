    GUIMUP is a client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD) written in GTKMM
    and C++. The program can be used with most Linux desktops (GNOME, 
    XFCE, KDE) and is covered by the General Public License (see below).

    The clean interface makes controlling MPD's many features easy and 
    intuitive. The focus is on mouse handling: playlist management is done 
    entirely by drag-&-drop; playback functions are directly accessible from
    the system tray. Guimup turns MPD into a perfect desktop music player.

    DEPENDENCIES

    To RUN this program depends on:

    libsoup (libsoup-2.4,  2.26 or above)
 
    To COMPILE from source additionally install the libgtkmm dev and libsoup
    dev packages.
    You will also need the usual dev packages, such as autoconf, make,
    automake and intltool. 'configure' will check this.

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install (will only copy the binary to /usr/bin)

    GNOME, XFCE and KDE

    Altough the program depends on GTKMM it does not require GNOME, nor is
    it integrated with GNOME in any way.

    USING GUIMUP

    If MPD is configured correctly it's all click, drag and drop really.

    The URL handling ("Add Stream") is rather basic. Direct links to binary
    audio-streams are added without a problem. Playlists of the m3u and pls
    format are processed to pick out the links pointing to the stream(s).
    Other playlist formats (asx, ram etc.) can not be handled. URL's that
    redirect can not be handled. Alternatively download the playlist yourself,
    copy the URL(s) that are in it and paste it in the "Add Stream" dialog.

    In the ~/.guimup.conf file you will find an entry called AlbumArt_File
    Here you can set a custom string that will be used first to find art
    in the folder where the music-file is located. 
    Example: AlbumArt_File=younameit

    Other 'hidden' options are:
    Font_Family=sans, DejaVu		(or =serif, Times )
    MPD_onQuit_command=mpd --kill	(or =killall mpd )
    MPD_onStart_command=mpd		(or =/path/to/mpd )
