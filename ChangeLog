      "Open with" from the file manager.
   * Program now runs in single-instance-mode by default.
   * New library mode: "Year" (i.e. date tag).

   * Replaygain mode can now be set on the fly from Quimup.
   * Added option to ignore leading 'the' when sorting artists.
   * Extended context menu for playlist operations (remove,
     save, shuffle etc.) 
   * Separate button for all playback modes (repeat, single, etc.)
   * More options, such as custom colors for the player window
     and the use of 'profiles' to connect with mpd.
   * Improved auto-detection of mpd's settings (on localhost).
